This career truly chose me.

I am an absolute *grease monkey*. I love working on cars, driving cars, looking at cars, talking about cars... I pretty much love everything about cars.
That being said, I was originally going into college to learn to be a Bioengineer since I loved Biology but also had an
interest in building practical solutions for the modern day (I wanted to 3D print body parts and stuff). But then I took
a programming class -- it was just as an elective, and I didn't really think much of taking it, but I was soon surprised
at how much I liked it! Something about being able to sit down a build something felt really nice. After taking one
more programming class to see if it was a fluke, I discovered that I loved programming and decided that that was what
I was going to do for the rest of my life.

Eventually down the road I took a web application development class, and found something that I loved more than
programming: web development!

I have a very strong creative side, and web development combines my love for software development and my creative
tendencies. That being said, I still haven't quite figured out which I enjoy more: front-end or back-end. I personally
enjoy both, and love being presented with challenges and overcoming them. I am currently looking forward to beginning
my carrer in computer science; I'll keep the car stuff as a hobby ;)

Eventually, though, I'd like to make it into the robotics industry. Very different from web development, I know, but I've always wanted to work on/build robots.
